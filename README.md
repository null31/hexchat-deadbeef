xchat-deadbeef-stripped-v2
=======================

This is a modified version of mwgg/xchat-deadbeef-stripped (is from iceTwy/xchat-deadbeef) Python 3 plugin,
aimed to strip the functionality to necessities only and modify the
output format. It does not check whether DeaDBeeF is running, and
can only output the results of /np command in like so:

* nickname is listening to: Artist - Album - Track | Playback / Length | Codec | yyyy kbps | zzzzzHZ

Unlike the original, this version does not check for whether or not
DeaDBeeF is running, solving certain annoyances on some systems, and
it is not able to control playback. The only function is to announce
current track in a format shown above. It includes Python 3 version ONLY.
